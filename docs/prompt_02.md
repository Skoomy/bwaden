ðŸ“Œ General-Purpose Equity Research Prompt (Valuation & Competitive Analysis)

Conduct a professional investment-grade valuation and strategic analysis of [Insert Company Name], publicly traded on [Insert Stock Exchange & Ticker Symbol], in [Currency].

Your analysis should include:
	1.	Business Model Breakdown: Decompose the company into core segments or business lines. For each segment, outline revenue, margin profile, growth drivers, and risks over a 3-year horizon.
	2.	Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Valuation: Assign valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, or DCF) to each segment based on its maturity, margin, and growth. Aggregate to derive total enterprise value and equity value. Adjust for net cash/debt. Output per-share fair value.
	3.	Peer Comparison: Select relevant peer companies in the same or adjacent industries. Compare valuation metrics (P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG), margin structure, and capital allocation (dividend, buybacks, reinvestment). Position the target company relative to peers.
	4.	Growth & Risk Outlook (3-Year Horizon): Analyze the macro, regulatory, technological, and cyclical factors that could affect the company. Identify key KPIs, industry trends, and strategic levers (e.g. M&A, product expansion, internationalization).
	5.	Investment Recommendation: Based on valuation, growth outlook, and competitive positioning, provide a clear recommendation (Buy/Hold/Sell). Include target price, upside/downside analysis, and scenario triggers for re-rating.

Tailor the tone and depth to match the standards of top-tier asset managers (e.g., Citadel, Lone Pine, TCI, Bain Capital Public Equity). Use structured tables and bullet points where helpful. Emphasize clarity, completeness, and defensibility of assumptions.
