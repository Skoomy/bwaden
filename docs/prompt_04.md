Conduct a full professional-grade investment analysis of [Insert SaaS Company Name], publicly traded on [Exchange + Ticker], denominated in [Currency].

Your analysis should follow a SaaS-focused framework and include the following sections:

⸻

	1.	Business Model and Revenue Streams:
	•	Break down by ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), Professional Services, and Other revenue.
	•	Segment by customer cohort (SMB vs. Enterprise), product lines/modules, and regional exposure.
	•	Describe pricing model (seat-based, usage-based, hybrid) and land-and-expand dynamics.
	2.	Key Metrics Analysis:
	•	Present the following KPIs:
	•	ARR and NRR (Net Revenue Retention)
	•	CAC Payback, LTV/CAC
	•	Gross Margin and Rule of 40
	•	Churn (logo and revenue), NDR trends
	•	Sales efficiency (S&M spend vs ARR)
	•	Compare to BVP Cloud Index or top public SaaS comps.
	3.	SOTP or Segment Valuation:
	•	If multiple product lines or business models, use Sum-of-the-Parts with EV/ARR, EV/Revenue, or EV/EBITDA multiples per segment.
	•	Justify multiples using comps with similar growth and margin profiles.
	•	Adjust for deferred revenue, SBC dilution, and net cash.
	4.	Peer Comparison (Valuation and Ops):
	•	Compare to 5–7 relevant SaaS peers across:
	•	EV/Revenue (TTM and NTM)
	•	Revenue Growth (YoY), Gross Margin
	•	Rule of 40, FCF margin
	•	PEG or EV/Revenue/Growth
	•	Highlight where [Company] stands out or lags (e.g., best-in-class NRR, weak sales efficiency, etc.)
	5.	3-Year Strategic Outlook & Risks:
	•	Assess product roadmap, TAM expansion, pricing power, and margin improvement trajectory.
	•	Evaluate customer concentration, dependency on cloud partners, and AI strategy (if applicable).
	•	Discuss risk factors (macro compression, seat-based model saturation, churn acceleration).
	6.	Investment View:
	•	Give a Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation with clear price target based on forward EV/Revenue or DCF.
	•	Justify with scenario modeling (e.g. Base vs Bull case), FCF potential, or margin expansion thesis.
	•	Optionally include a “Red Team” bear case view for completeness.
